# A Tabletop RPG Dice Statistics Generator

This application determines the average and standard deviation of a set of dice.  To use, enter the desired number of dice of each type in the appropriate boxes, then click "Start Rolling!"  The dice generator will take a large number of internal samples to produce the estimated average and standard deviation of the chosen dice.

The last processed roll will always be stored above the mean and standard deviation output entries, so that the roll may be referenced even if the numbers of dice in the input boxes have been changed.
